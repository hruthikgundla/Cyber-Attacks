# Toward Detection and attribution of Cyber- attacks in IoT enabled cyber-physical systems.
This is a software based on Machine Learning which provides information about the types of cyber-attacks to be encountered on a given dataset. In this project we have  used Sewage water treatment dataset. And tried to determine the cyber-attacks.

### Let's see how to perform the whole activity on your own computer.
Firstly you need to have "Anaconda Navigator" Installed on your computer, and after installing it, navigate to "jupyter notebook" in the list.<br>
- Now create a folder with your desired name and open it.
  <br>
you need to install all the necessary libraries.
 - Here is the whole list of libraries with their versions: <br>

<br>
After installing all the libraries, import the code given in this repository named "Main.py"
https://github.com/hruthikgundla/Cyber-Attacks/blob/main/11.%20Towards%20Detection%20and%20Attribution%20of%20Cyber-Attacks/Main.py
After importing the code, replace the dataset, with your own dataset and run the code.
There you go, now you have the software to detect the cyber-attacks to a dataset.
